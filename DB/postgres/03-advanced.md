In PostgreSQL, you can store composite types or custom objects within an array. However, there are a few considerations and limitations to be aware of:

1. **Composite Types:** PostgreSQL allows you to create composite types that represent structured objects. You can define a composite type with fields of various data types, and then use this composite type in an array.

2. **Array of Composite Types:** You can create an array of a composite type, effectively storing a collection of objects in an array.

Here's a basic example of how you can define a composite type and use it in an array:

```sql
-- Define a composite type representing a point with x and y coordinates
CREATE TYPE point AS (x int, y int);

-- Create a table with an array of points
CREATE TABLE objects (
    id serial PRIMARY KEY,
    points point[]
);

-- Insert data into the table
INSERT INTO objects (points) VALUES
   (ARRAY[(1, 2), (3, 4)]::point[]);
```

In this example, we define a composite type `point` with `x` and `y` fields. We then create a table `objects` with an array of `point` types. You can insert data into this table as arrays of points.

Keep in mind that working with arrays of composite types can be more complex, especially when querying and updating data. Additionally, PostgreSQL doesn't provide built-in indexing for individual fields within an array of composite types. You may need to write custom functions to access and manipulate these objects within the array effectively.

When working with arrays of composite types in PostgreSQL, querying and manipulating the data can be a bit more complex compared to simple arrays of scalar types. To query and manipulate the data in an array of composite types, you'll typically use functions and operators specifically designed for this purpose. Here are some common operations:

**1. Accessing Elements in an Array:**

- To access a specific element in an array of composite types, you use the same subscript notation as with regular arrays, but you need to specify the field within the composite type.
- Example: `SELECT points[1].x, points[1].y FROM objects;` retrieves the `x` and `y` values of the first point in the array.

**2. Checking for Composite Type Equality:**

- You can use the `=` operator to compare entire composite types in the array.
- Example: `SELECT * FROM objects WHERE points[1] = ROW(1, 2);` retrieves rows where the first point in the array is equal to (1, 2).

**3. Unnesting and Aggregating:**

- You can use `unnest` to transform an array of composite types into a set of rows, and then use aggregate functions to work with the data.
- Example: `SELECT id, (unnest(points)).* FROM objects;` unnests the array of points and selects all fields, providing a row for each point.

**4. Array Functions:**

- PostgreSQL provides array functions that can be used with arrays of composite types. For example, you can use `array_agg` to aggregate data into an array.
- Example: `SELECT id, array_agg(points) FROM objects GROUP BY id;` aggregates the points into an array for each `id`.

Remember that the specific queries will depend on your table and composite type definitions. You'll need to adjust the examples to match your schema and use case. Working with arrays of composite types offers flexibility but may require more complex queries to access and manipulate the data within the composite objects.
