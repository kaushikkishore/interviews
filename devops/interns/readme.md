Certainly, here are the exact questions for points 1-7 related to practical Kubernetes knowledge:

1. **Container Deployment:**

   - "Given a Docker image (e.g., `kaushikkishore/application:v1` PORT `3000`), can you demonstrate how to create a Kubernetes Deployment to run three replicas of this container in the cluster?"

2. **Scaling and Autoscaling:**

   - "Imagine your application is experiencing increased traffic. How would you configure Horizontal Pod Autoscaling (HPA) in Kubernetes to automatically scale the number of pods based on CPU utilization?"

3. **Rolling Updates and Rollbacks:**

   - "Suppose you have a Kubernetes Deployment running an application, and you need to perform a rolling update to a new version (`v2`) of that application. Can you demonstrate how to perform the update, and then, in case of issues, show us how to roll back to the previous version (`v1`)?"

4. **Service Configuration:**

   - "In Kubernetes, there are different types of services (NodePort, LoadBalancer, ClusterIP) for exposing applications. Could you explain when you would use each type and demonstrate how to create a LoadBalancer service?"

5. **ConfigMaps and Secrets:**

   - "Can you create a ConfigMap and a Secret in Kubernetes, and then show us how to mount these as environment variables or files in a Pod? Provide an example of what kind of data you might store in each."

6. **Health Checks and Liveness Probes:**
   - "Discuss the significance of health checks and liveness probes in Kubernetes. Can you demonstrate how to add a liveness probe to a Pod's configuration and explain under what circumstances the probe would restart the Pod?"

These questions will help you assess an intern's practical knowledge of Kubernetes, including their ability to perform common tasks and configurations in a Kubernetes cluster.
